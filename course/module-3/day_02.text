# Access to Linux  System :

    Each operating system has a different protocol or client that is 
    used to access the system.


    Example :

    window          =           Remote Desktop(RDP)
    VMware ESX      =           vSphere client 
    Linux           =           Putty, SecureCRT
                                SSH from Linux to Linux [possible]
